//    How to make your own MAP!

//    To create a wall, simply put in the corrdinates and "true" next to it.
//    Corrdinates are stored in a 7 digit long number, 
//    the first 3 digits are the Y coordinate, the next 3 are the X coordinate, and the last digit is a dummy digit so it works.
//    Without the dummy digit it would break so you have to add it.
